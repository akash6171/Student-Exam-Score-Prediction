**📘 Student Exam Score Prediction using Machine Learning:**

This project focuses on predicting students' exam scores based on various academic and personal factors, helping identify key contributors to academic performance.

**🎯 Objective:**

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts students' final exam scores using features such as study time, attendance, past performance, parental education, and more.

**📊 Key Features:**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover performance patterns,
Regression model development using:
Linear Regression,
Decision Tree Regressor,
Random Forest Regressor,
Model performance evaluation using RMSE and MAE score,
Feature importance analysis to understand what factors influence scores the most

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn),
Jupyter Notebook,
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
